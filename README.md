# Focus And Context Control App

This is a node.js app designed to run and monitor the Focus and Context project while it is installed remotely. We can schedule shutdowns and startups as well as reboot from a crashed launch.

I also aspire to have the app send a "still alive" call to my control app so it can reboot it on a hang and to create a web GUI which will allow me to access it remotely.
